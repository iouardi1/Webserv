In this project, We aim to develop a C++98-compatible HTTP web server entirely from scratch. This web server exhibits the capability to manage a range of HTTP requests, including GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It proficiently serves static files sourced from a designated root directory while also supporting dynamic content through CGI.

In addition, our web server boasts the ability to efficiently handle multiple client connections concurrently, leveraging the power of the select() function. This ensures that the server can effectively respond to diverse client requests in a non-blocking manner, enhancing overall performance and responsiveness.
